Boot-out
========
Change and compile optimized Bootstrap code along with the project itself, _easily_!.

**Note**: This is developed for Windows (7) platform only. (although this depends on Windows versions of some Linux/Unix command-line tools.)

Dependencies
------------
* 	**Java** Runtime
* 	**Node.js**
* 	**lessc** (LESS Compiler, depends on Node and NPM)
* 	**Cygwin** / **MinGW** / **Gow** (recommended)

_Remeber to add each dependencie's `\bin` folders' paths to Windows Environment Variables._

To-do's
-------
1. Needs some kind of cool **x** efficient equivalent to Bootstrap's 'Customize'.

How to use
----------
Change stuff and just run `pack`. It'll build and pack everything into a folder named `package`.
