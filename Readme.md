Change and compile optimized Bootstrap code along with the project itself, _easily_!.

------------
* 	**Java** Runtime
* 	**Node.js**
* 	**lessc** (LESS Compiler, depends on Node and NPM)
* 	**Cygwin** / **MinGW** / **Gow** (recommended)

_Remeber to add each dependencie's `\bin` folders' paths to Windows Environment Variables._

To-do's
-------
1. Needs some kind of cool*efficient equivalent to Bootstrap's 'Customize'.

How to use
----------
Change stuff and run `js` to build Javascript and then `pack` to build CSS and move everything (including Javascript) into a folder called `package`.
